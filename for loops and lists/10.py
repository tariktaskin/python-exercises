Question 10:
You will be given the elements
 of A set with N elements and B 
 set with M elements (2 <= N, M <= 100).
  Write the program that finds the elements
   of the A-B set. In the first line of the entry,
    the number N will be given, followed by the
     elements of the A set. In the second line,
      first the number M, then the elements of 
      the set B will be given. When printing the
       result on the output, you must print the 
       elements in the order they appear in set A. 
       Intersections are guaranteed not to be empty 
       sets. Set elements will only consist of 
       alphabet letters and numbers.
